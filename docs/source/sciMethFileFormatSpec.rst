.. _secPurpose:

Purpose
^^^^^^^

   2.1.1 This specification is intended to define a cross-platform,
   interoperable file storage and transfer format to encode a variety
   of experiments of different nature. Scientific studies are understood
   here according to constructs commonly defined in the branch of
   statistics concerning the analysis and design of experiments.

   

.. _secScope:

Scope
^^^^^

   2.2.1. TAR (Tape ARchiver) is a file format that can wrap
   files and directories so that they can be treated as a single file. It
   was originally developed to store data in a magnetic tape, but has
   since then survived and thrived being a popular choice as an option
   when a pipe among programs is needed as well as to serve for remote
   access. The standard specification of TAR files can be found in
   http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/
   
   2.2.2. XML (Extensible Markup Language) specification defines an XML
   document as a well-formed text, meaning that it satisfies a list of
   syntax rules provided in the specification. XML is a W3C recommendation
   that was designed for ease of implementation and for interoperability
   with both SGML and HTML. XML files are plain text files encoding an XML
   compliant XML document having both a logical and a physical structure.
   The standard specification of XML files can be found in
   https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/
   
   
   2.2.3. The scientific method is a mathematical formalization of the
   scientific experimental process. In this mathemtical formalization
   a number of mathematical objects co-exist and are related permitting
   controlling and informing scientists about the bias and uncertainty
   associated to measurements and experiments.
   
   2.2.4. The scientific method file format provides a way to encode
   all the mathematical objects related to a scientific study. The file
   format exploits the TAR and XML specifications as a base file format,
   describing only the internal contents of the main TAR file and some of
   its internal content in terms of XML files contained in the root TAR folder.
   
   2.2.5. In principle, the scientific method file format is thought to
   support generic scientific studies and experiments from different branches
   of science.

The scientific method TAR Files
-------------------------------

   3.0.1 A scientific method document encloses information about one
   scientific study as well as additional generic document information and
   client software settings. All this is stored within the root of the
   wrapping TAR folder.
   
   
.. _secGenericDocInfo:

Generic document information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   3.1.1 This collects information related to the document itself such as
   file version, the creation and last moditification date, etc. This
   information is stored in
   a single ``docinfo.xml`` file located in the .tar root folder.
   
   3.1.2 ***PENDING*** definition of the associated XML Document Type Declaration (DTD)
   
   
.. _secSWsettings:


Client software settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   3.2.1 This collects information related to settings of the client software
   using the file format such as user preferences and software directives. This
   information is stored in
   a single ``config.xml`` file located in the .tar root folder.
   
   
   3.2.2 ***PENDING*** definition of the associated XML Document Type Declaration (DTD)
   
.. _secStudy:


Scientific study 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   3.3.0.1 This collects information related to the scientific study. A
   scientific study is a collection of observations from a set of experimental
   units (referred collectively as cohort) according to some set of
   acquisition rules referred to as study design. The information is stored
   in 3 files and a list of folders;
   
   * ``study.xml`` - Contains information about the elements included in
     the study indexing the cohort, design and observations
   * ``cohort.xml`` - Contains information about the cohort i.e. experimental
     units
   * ``design.xml`` - Contains information about the study design e.g.
     experimental groups, factors, endpoints, etc
   * ``observationXXX`` - A folder containig information about a single
     observation, where XXX is a numerical ID of the observation which is
     unique within the study. Note that an observation may in turn contain
     information about many data items.
